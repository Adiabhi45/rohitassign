## Creating Sample Face Assets

If you don't have assets yet, you can:
1. Create simple shapes using graphic design tools (Figma, Inkscape, GIMP, Photoshop)
2. Use AI image generators (DALL-E, Midjourney) to create individual facial features
3. Download free assets from sites like:
   - OpenGameArt.org
   - Kenney.nl
   - Itch.io (game assets)
   - FreePik (with attribution)
4. Draw your own using digital art software (Procreate, Krita, etc.)
5. Use emoji or cartoon face parts as inspiration

## Layering Order (from back to front)
1. Face shape (base layer)
2. Ears (if visible)
3. Eyes
4. Eyebrows
5. Nose
6. Mouth
7. Facial hair (if any)
8. Hair (overlays the face)
9. Accessories (glasses, hats, etc.)

## Tips

- Keep file sizes reasonable (under 500KB per image)
- Maintain consistent style across all facial features (cartoon, realistic, pixel art, etc.)
- Use transparent backgrounds for best layering results
- Create multiple variations of each feature for variety
- Test images in the application to ensure proper sizing and positioning
- Consider creating features in different skin tones and colors
- Features should align well when placed together (eyes at same height, etc.)
